## 1. Playing With PageRank  
  
**You'll verify for your self that PageRank works by performing calculations on a small universe of web pages. Let's use the 6 page universe that we had in the course notes.**  
<br>  
<center>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spitakiss/DATA605_Work/master/Week10/URLGraph.PNG)</center>  
<br>  

**For this directed graph, perform the following calculations in R:**  
  
**Form the *A* matrix.**  
  
The directed graph above can be represented in matrix form as follows:  

$$\textbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1/2 & 1/2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1/3 & 1/3 & 0 & 0 & 1/3 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 & 1/2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1/2 & 0 & 1/2 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}$$
<br>  
  
Each row *i* of the matrix $\textbf{A}$ corresponds to associated outlinks (where nonzero), and each column *j* corresponds to inlinks.    

Here is the matrix initialized in R:  

```{r}
# rows of matrix
at1 <- c(0, 1/2, 1/2, 0, 0, 0)
at2 <- rep(0,6)
at3 <- c(1/3, 1/3, 0, 0, 1/3, 0)
at4 <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1/2, 1/2)
at5 <- c(0, 0, 0, 1/2, 0, 1/2)
at6 <- c(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)

# matrix A formed from individual rows
A <- matrix(rbind(at1,at2,at3,at4,at5,at6),6,6)

# print A
formatC(A, format="f", digits=3)

```
  
**Then, introduce decay and form the B matrix as we did in the course notes.**  
  
Matrix $\textbf{B}$ is formulated as follows:  
$$\textbf{B}=d\textbf{A} + \frac{(1-d)}{n}\textbf{ee}^T $$  
The scalar $n$ represents the number of webpages in our universe, scalar $d$ is our selected decay factor, and $\textbf{ee}^T$ is a square matrix with the same dimensions as matrix $\textbf{A}$ and with all elements set to 1.    

Before we implement the formula above, we must modify the original matrix *A*:  
  
* Node 2 in our six webpage universe is referred to as a "dangling node."  If a web surfer reaches new webpages by clicking on hyperlinks from other webpages, then he inevitably get stuck after entering Node 2.  That is, Node 2 has no outbound links.  
* The dangling node phenomenon is problematic, as our ultimate goal is to construct a transition matrix $\textbf{B}$ so that repeated left multiplications ,*N*, of the transpose matrix, $\textbf{B}^T$ to an arbitrary column vector, $\textbf{r}_0$, converges to a unique positive vector, $\textbf{r}_f$. That is, ${ { (\textbf{B} }^{ T }) }^{ N }{ \textbf{r} }_{ 0 }={ \textbf{r} }_{ f }$.  
* One key requirement for convergence is that our transition matrix is stochastic, which requires all non-negative entries and each row of the matrix to sum to one.  While our original matrix $\textbf{A}$ has all non-negative entries, row 2 sums to zero.      

We apply the following adjustments to the original matrix $\textbf{A}$ to ensure our matrix is stochastic:  
$$\textbf{A}^*=\textbf{A} + \textbf{a}(\frac{1}{n}\textbf{e}^T)$$  
Here, $\textbf{a}$ is a column vector with element *i* set to 1 if row *i* of matrix $\textbf{A}$ is a dangling node, and 0 otherwise. The scalar *n* refers to the total number of webpages in our universe, and $\textbf{e}^T$ is a row vector of 1s.  
  
Let's implement the modified matrix, $\textbf{A}$ in R:  

```{r}

# number of webpages in universe 
n <- nrow(A)

# A modified, a stochastic matrix with each row summing to 1
A_mod <- A + (apply(A,1,sum)!=1) * 1/n

# print A modified
formatC(A_mod, format="f", digits=3)
```
  
We are now ready to form matrix B, using the formula described earlier, but now substituting $\textbf{A}^*$ for $\textbf{A}$ in the earlier equation.    

```{r}
# set decay factor
d <- 0.85

# initialize matrix B  
B <- d*A_mod + (1-d)/n 

# print B
formatC(B, format="f", digits=3)
```
 
  
The additional adjustments applied to $\textbf{A}^*$ in our equation for  $\textbf{B}$ ensure convergence of this Markov process:  
  
* The matrix is now irreducible, which means that each node is connected to every other node--refer to the positive probabilities for each element *ij* in matrix $\textbf{B}$.  
* The matrix is aperiodic, as indicated by the positive probability of a web surfer staying within the same webpage with each successive iteration  
  
<br>  

**Start with a uniform rank vector $\textbf{r}_0$ and perform power iterations on $B$ till convergence.  That is, compute the solution $\textbf{r}_f$. That is, ${ { (\textbf{B} }^{ T }) }^{ N }{ \textbf{r} }_{ 0 }={ \textbf{r} }_{ f }$. Attempt this for a sufficiently large $n$ so that $\textbf{r}_f$ actually converges.**  
  
Below, we calculate $\textbf{r}_f$ for various values of $n$.  We see almost no change in the resulting vector between $N=20$ and $N=30$.  

```{r}

# install expm package, if not already installed.
# package allows us to take exponents of matrices
if (!require('expm')) {install.packages('expm');library(expm)}

# initial, uniform rank vector
r0 <- rep(1/6,6)


# show rank vector after 0, 10, 20, and 30 iterations
# rf = B^T * r0
for (i in seq(0,30, by=10)){
  print(paste0("rank vector at iteration ",i,":"))
  print((t(B) %^% i) %*% r0)
  print("-----------------------------")

}


```


**Compute the eigen-decomposition of $B$ and verify that you indeed get an eigenvalue of 1 as the largest eigenvalue.**  

Using R's 'eigen()` function, we see that the largest eigenvalue is 1:  
  
```{r}
# eigen-decomposition of matrix B^T
eigen(t(B))
```

**Verify that the corresponding eigenvector is the same vector that you obtained in the previous power iteration method.**  
  
Let's calculate $r_f$ using $N=30$ iterations and normalize to a unit vector.  Then, compare to the eigenvector using R's built-in eigen() function:  

```{r}
# rf after 30 iterations
rf_pwrmthd <- t(B) %^% 30 %*% r0

# normalize rf_pwrmthd to unit vector 
rf_pwrmthd_unit <- rf_pwrmthd / sqrt(sum(rf_pwrmthd^2))

# eigenvector associated with lambda = 1, from eigen() function
rf_eigen1 <-  eigen(t(B))$vectors[,1]

# verify that this is equal to eigenvector calculation using eigen(), given small error tolerance
abs(rf_pwrmthd_unit - rf_eigen1) < 0.0001
```

**Further, verify this eigenvector has all positive entries and it sums to 1.**  

```{r}
# verify all positive entries in eigenvector
Re(rf_pwrmthd) > 0

# verify entries sum to 1
sum(rf_pwrmthd)

```
  
**Use the graph package in R and its page.rank method to compute the Page Rank of the graph as given in A. Note that you don't need to apply decay. The package starts with a connected graph and applies decay internally.**  
```{r}
# install and/or load igraph package 
if (!require('igraph')) {install.packages('igraph');library(igraph)}

# plot original matrix A in igraph
A_graph <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A, weighted=TRUE)
plot(A_graph)

# calculate PageRank given original matrix A 
rf_igraph <- page.rank(graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A, weighted=TRUE))
rf_igraph$vector
```

**Verify that you do get the same PageRank vector as the two approaches above.**  

For consistency we'll normalize the PageRank to be of length 1, and then compare to the other two approaches. 

```{r}  
# normalize pagerank vector
rf_igraph_unit <- rf_igraph$vector / sqrt(sum(rf_igraph$vector^2))  
rf_igraph_unit

# verify that rf_igraph_unit is equal to eigenvector calculation using eigen(), given small error tolerance
abs(rf_igraph_unit - rf_eigen1) < 0.0001

# verify that rf_igraph_unit is equal to eigenvector from power method with N=30, given small error tolerance
abs(rf_igraph_unit - rf_eigen1) < 0.0001

```
